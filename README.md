Following completion of this task, students should be able to:

<ul>

 <li>Write C++ programs using standard I/O, basic control structures and functions.</li>

</ul>

Question 1 (Selection and Repetition Control Structures)

Write a C++ program that reads an integer value representing a year from the user.  The purpose of the program is to determine if the year is a leap year (and therefore has 29 days in February) in the Gregorian calendar.  A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is also divisible by 100 but not 400.  For example, the year 2003 is not a leap year, but 2004 is.  The year 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100, but the year 2000 is a leap year because even though it is divisible by 100, it is also divisible by 400.  Produce an error message for any input value less than 1582 (the year the Gregorian calendar was adopted).

Continue to request for another input until the user enters zero (0) for the year.

<strong> </strong>Question 2 (Using Functions)

Write a C++ program that uses three functions to perform the following tasks:

<ul>

 <li>The first function should read the price of an item sold at a grocery store together with the quantity and discount rate given if any. All values entered should be validated accordingly.  Return all the values to main().</li>

 <li>The second function is to calculate and return the total purchase price for the item.</li>

 <li>The last function should display the price, quantity, discount amount, and also the total purchase price.</li>

</ul>

The user should be given a choice to continue with another item.  Before the program terminates, display also the grand total price of all the items purchased.
